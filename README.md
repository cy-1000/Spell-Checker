# Spell-Checker
Spell Checker implemented in Java using a Hash Table. 

Uses a hash table to check to see if word passed into the program is a valid word. If it is the program returns nothing and if it isn't, the program will provide suggestions on valid words. 

example input:

"'<absolute-path-to-dictionary-file>'" helli

output: helli? did you mean: hello, hells

Suggests words that are one off of the passed in word
